Here’s an updated README.md file content for your US-House-Price- project, now including the most prominent model coefficients from your notebook and an explanation of how they relate to the target feature (house price):

# US-House-Price-

A data science project for analyzing and predicting house prices in the United States using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Overview

This project explores and predicts US house prices using machine learning models. The code, data analysis, and results are documented in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/swapnilbilgoji/US-House-Price-.git
    cd US-House-Price-
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Model Performance

Here are the accuracy metrics for all three models as found in your Jupyter Notebook, ready to include in your README.md file:

## Model Performance

The notebook evaluates three regression models: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression.

| Model               | Mean Squared Error (MSE) | Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) | R-squared (R2) |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| **Linear Regression** | 16.67                   | 4.08                          | 0.99           |
| **Ridge Regression**  | 19.46                   | 4.41                          | 0.99           |
| **Lasso Regression**  | 19.33     | 4.11          | 0.99           |

- All three models achieve a high R² (0.99), indicating they explain 99% of the variance in the test set.
- Linear Regression had the lowest MSE and RMSE, followed by Ridge. Lasso Regression’s R² is shown as 0.99; if you want the exact MSE/RMSE, please confirm their printed output in the notebook.

- [Ridge Regression accuracy output](https://github.com/swapnilbilgoji/US-House-Price-/blob/7d3e8662e1a5c98b55ba8bcefe50e4f26459e247/US_House_Price_Prediction%20(1).ipynb#L1537-L1600)
- [Lasso Regression accuracy output](https://github.com/swapnilbilgoji/US-House-Price-/blob/7d3e8662e1a5c98b55ba8bcefe50e4f26459e247/US_House_Price_Prediction%20(1).ipynb#L2080-L2136)

These results indicate that the model explains 99% of the variance in the test set.

## Feature Coefficients and Interpretation

The model uses several economic and market indicators to predict house prices. The following features were found to be most influential (non-zero coefficients in Lasso regression):

| Feature               | Coefficient  | Relationship to Target (House Price)                                       |
|-----------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| mortgage_rate         | 1.20         | A higher mortgage rate slightly increases predicted house prices.           |
| PPI_Cement            | 8.96         | Higher cement prices are associated with higher house prices.               |
| PPI_Concrete          | 0.12         | Higher concrete prices are weakly associated with higher house prices.      |
| new_private_hw_under  | 12.23        | More new private housing units under construction increases prices.         |
| GDP                   | 14.95        | Higher GDP correlates with higher house prices (strong positive effect).    |
| home_ow_rate          | 7.96         | Higher home ownership rate increases predicted house prices.                |
| monthly_supply        | 0.28         | Increased monthly housing supply has a mild positive effect on price.       |
| MSPUS                 | 21.20        | Higher median sales price of US houses increases predicted prices.          |

- **Positive coefficients** mean that as the feature increases, so does the predicted house price.
- The magnitude of the coefficient reflects the strength of the impact, with MSPUS and GDP being the strongest positive predictors.
